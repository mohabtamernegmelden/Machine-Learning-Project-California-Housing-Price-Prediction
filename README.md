About Dataset
It is a basic housing dataset to test out your regression models. You can try out different machine learning models on it.
It has many useful features that gives you insight into the world of data.

# **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
1.  There are a large number of factors that can affect the value of a house property (eg. location, size, condition, time), these factors can change quite substantially from one property to another

2.   The housing market itself is quite a volatile industry, and is quite
dependent on demand and supply fluctuations, not to even mention economic factors sch as interest rates & inflation, so its quite a challenge to predict the price variation over time

3.   It's also quite challenging to predict housing prices due to the limited data that is available, most datasets contain a limited number of features related to each property, such is why feature engineering is quite important

4.   The California housing dataaset contains different house related attributes for properties located in California

# **Study Aim**

The objective of this project is to build and evaluate regression models capable of predicting the median house value in California districts based on geographical, demographic, and housing-related features. 
The project emphasizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model comparison to achieve optimal predictive performance.
